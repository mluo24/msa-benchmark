## Steps to Reproduce

Note that all of these steps (and the scripts themselves) have been tested on macOS. No guarantees can be made for any other operating systems.

1. Clone this repo as well as the (FastSP)[https://github.com/smirarab/FastSP] repo. FastSP will be used to calculate some of the measured metrics in the benchmark test.

2. Download the libraries for the following algorithms (they all need to be the command line versions):
    * ClustalW
    * MAFFT
    * TODO: writeup the rest of the algorithm download

3. Run (script) ...

TODO: finish steps for reproducing results
